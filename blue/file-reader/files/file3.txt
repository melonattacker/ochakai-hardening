Inside the pyramid, Leo discovered a series of intricate puzzles and traps. Every step was a test of his courage and wit. With the help of the magical compass and the wisdom he had gained on his journey, Leo solved the puzzles and made his way deeper into the pyramid.

At last, he reached the final chamber. There, in the center of the room, was the legendary treasure: a golden chest filled with ancient jewels and artifacts. But as Leo approached, he realized the real treasure wasn’t the gold—it was the adventure he had experienced and the friends he had made along the way. With a smile on his face, Leo decided to leave the gold behind and return home, knowing that his true reward was the journey itself.
